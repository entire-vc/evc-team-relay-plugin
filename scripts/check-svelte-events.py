"""Static reachability check for Svelte custom (non-DOM) events: for every
`<Component on:eventName={handler}>` listener in this tree, prove that
`eventName` can actually be emitted by `Component` -- either directly via
`dispatch("eventName", ...)` inside it, or transitively via a bare
`on:eventName` forward through a chain of child components down to a real
dispatch call.

Why this exists: a producer/consumer pair is joined by nothing but two
string literals in two different files --

    producer:  dispatch("goBack", {})
    consumer:  <ModalBackBar on:goBack={handleGoBack} />

-- and NOTHING in this repo's toolchain checks that match: not tsc (event
names are untyped strings to it), not svelte-check (it type-checks values,
not event-name existence), not gate 4 (it reads identifiers; this is a
string literal plus an attribute name), not jest/lint/build (none of them
execute the click-to-dispatch DOM interaction). Confirmed by direct
experiment (Mesh #8c9a4223, 2026-08-28): renamed a definitely-LIVE listener
(`SettingsPanel.svelte`'s `on:goBack`, wired to the visible "back" button in
the settings panel) to a bogus name -- tsc/lint/svelte-check/build/jest all
stayed at their exact pre-break numbers. Nothing noticed a real UI control
had just been severed.

This is the same class of gap as population B in Mesh #6f9a8eb0/!237
(`Object.defineProperty(obj, "memberName", ...)`, a string key past every
type checker) and the mock drift in #00631a54 -- a runtime-string join that
no static type system sees through -- but worse here: the cost isn't a
silently-stopped-checking test, it's a silently-broken UI control.

## The mistake this gate exists to not repeat

Mesh #a4ccff97's own accepted methodology was "break the event name, and if
NOTHING goes red, that's proof of deadness." That's exactly backwards for
Svelte custom events: NOTHING in this repo's gates executes a click, so a
LIVE listener produces the identical all-green result as a genuinely DEAD
one when its name is broken. The experiment above proves it. A gate that
cannot fail on a live sample is not a gate -- it's a coin flip that always
lands on the same side. This script's own `--self-test` runs the SAME
experiment as its own positive control, and this control is a NON-NEGOTIABLE
part of trusting a green run from this checker (see `check-svelte-events.sh`).

## Method

1. Parse every `.svelte` file's `<script>` section for `dispatch("name", ...)`
   / `dispatch('name', ...)` call sites (both quote styles; a computed
   dispatch like `dispatch(cond ? "apply" : "close")` is handled by scanning
   the whole call's argument text for quoted identifiers rather than
   requiring the literal to be the very next token).
2. Parse every file's template for component-tag usages (`<CapitalizedTag
   ...>` or `<svelte:component this=... ...>`) and every `on:eventName`
   attribute on them -- bound (`on:eventName={handler}`, a real listener
   whose reachability must be proven) or bare (`on:eventName`, a transparent
   forward of the child's own event of that name up to THIS component's own
   consumers).
3. Resolve each component tag to the `.svelte` file it names, via this
   file's own `import X from "./X.svelte"` statements. `<svelte:component
   this={expr}>` cannot be resolved this way in general (an arbitrary
   runtime expression) -- the one live site in this tree
   (`SettingsPanel.svelte`) is adjudicated explicitly below, the same way
   `check-naming.py`'s baskets record a human judgment call rather than
   re-deriving it every run.
4. `live(file, name)` = file directly dispatches `name`, OR some bare
   forward `on:name` in file's template targets a child component C with
   `live(resolve(C), name)` true. Memoized DFS, cycle-safe.
5. Every BOUND listener `<Tag on:name={handler}>` must have `live(resolve
   (Tag), name)` true. A violation is reported (file:line, target, name).

Signature = (file, line, target component, event name) -- not just a count,
so `--max-work N`-style ratchets remain possible if this basket is ever
non-empty (it currently is not -- see MANUAL basket below and the ratchet
baseline file).

Exit codes: 0 = no unreachable bound listeners (beyond the frozen baseline),
1 = new ones found, 2 = could not parse a trustworthy result -- fail CLOSED.
