"""Type-check __tests__/ via `tsc -p tsconfig.tests.json`, ratcheted against a
frozen baseline of pre-existing errors.

Why this exists: tsconfig.json's `include` is `**/*.ts` but its `exclude`
drops `__tests__` entirely, and ts-jest runs with `isolatedModules: true`
(per-file transpile, no type-checking) -- so nothing in this repo's gates
ever type-checked a file under __tests__. A hand-rolled mock that declares
its OWN shape instead of referencing the real production type can drift
after a rename with ZERO signal from tsc/jest/lint/build, because the mock's
interface is self-consistent on its own terms; only an assertion that
happens to read the now-stale field turns it into a *test* failure, and even
then only by accident. Confirmed twice in one evening in the same file
(__tests__/crdtBackgroundSyncPoller.test.ts):

  - FakeFolder.connected -> isOnline (MR !228): the real VaultShare/
    ProviderBacked field was renamed; the mock's own `connected: boolean`
    field was left behind, every mock folder read `isOnline` as `undefined`
    (falsy) in the real _poll() code, and 8 assertions failed for a reason
    that had nothing to do with what they were testing.
  - FakeFile.guid -> entityGuid (MR !235, closing Mesh #fe4e6843): same
    shape, one field later. Reverting `entityGuid` to `guid` was proven
    (verifier's own subsitution) to make 2 tests silently stop checking
    what they claimed to check, rather than fail loudly.

Fix applied alongside this gate (not by this gate -- see
__tests__/crdtBackgroundSyncPoller.test.ts): `FakeFile`/`FakeFolder` now
`extends Pick<Document, ...>` / `Pick<VaultShare, ...>` for the specific
fields the real production code under test actually reads off them
(`isOnline`, `entityGuid`, `workspaceId`), instead of declaring those fields
freehand. That convention is what gives a *rename* teeth: renaming
`Document.entityGuid` breaks the `Pick<Document, "entityGuid">` reference
itself, at the mock's own declaration, independent of whatever this gate
does. This gate is the OTHER half -- without it, `__tests__` is still
outside tsc's reach and that broken `Pick<>` reference would never be
compiled in the first place. Fields that are the mock's own bookkeeping (not
a mirror of a real field the production code reads through this mock, e.g.
FakeFile.path/`__isDocument`) are deliberately NOT forced through `Pick<>` --
there is nothing in production to pin them to.

Why a ratchet, not a bare "zero errors" gate: a full `tsc -p
tsconfig.tests.json` run surfaces 209 pre-existing errors (measured
2026-08-28) across 17 files that predate this task and are out of its scope
to fix -- missing `import type` under verbatimModuleSyntax, `Response`/mock
type mismatches, wrong argument counts against an already-changed real
signature, etc. Gating on zero would either block CI on unrelated debt
indefinitely, or invite disabling the whole gate at the first false start --
both worse than the blind spot this closes. Same shape as
`scripts/check-naming.sh --max-work N` and
`scripts/check-svelte-types.py`'s own svelte-check baseline. The baseline
shrinks over time as that debt gets fixed elsewhere; it must never be edited
to silence a genuinely new error.

Signature = (file, code, message) -- deliberately NOT (file, line, col).
Line numbers shift on any unrelated edit above the error in the same file;
keying on them would make the gate flap on every nearby diff. The error
CODE is included (unlike check-svelte-types.py's (file, message) alone)
because tsc's own messages are short and generic enough ("Expected 0
arguments, but got 1.") to collide across genuinely different bugs in the
same file more often than svelte-check's longer prose does; the code adds a
cheap extra dimension of precision at no cost.

Usage:
    check-tests-types.py                          # compare against baseline, exit 0/1/2
    check-tests-types.py --update-baseline         # regenerate the baseline file
    check-tests-types.py --tsconfig PATH           # override tsconfig (self-test uses this)
    check-tests-types.py --cwd PATH                # run tsc from a different directory

Exit codes: 0 = no new errors (baseline holds or has shrunk), 1 = new/
regressed errors found, 2 = could not run or parse a trustworthy tsc result
-- fail CLOSED, never silently "clean" on a probe that could not look.
