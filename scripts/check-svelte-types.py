"""Type-check .svelte <script> (and template expression) blocks via svelte-check,
ratcheted against a frozen baseline of pre-existing errors.

Why this exists: tsconfig.json's `include` is TS-only (**/*.ts), and jest never
transforms .svelte files, so nothing in this repo's gates ever type-checked a
.svelte file. A class member renamed across the TS surface (e.g. by the gate-4
naming waves) can go stale in a .svelte consumer -- script block OR template
expression -- with zero red from tsc/jest/lint/build/check-naming.sh. Two real
runtime regressions of exactly this shape shipped past 4 rounds of independent
review before a manual sweep caught them (NavTrail.svelte, FolderPathAutocomplete
.svelte -- see Mesh #acf0e621). A third (EditorStatusActions.svelte, W15) was
caught by a similar manual sweep the same day, including a case embedded in
template markup rather than a <script> block (`data-filename={liveView.view...}`).

Why a ratchet, not a bare "zero errors" gate: a full `svelte-check` run across
this codebase surfaces 37 pre-existing type errors (measured 2026-08-28) that
predate this task and are out of its scope to fix -- unrelated bugs (missing
generic type arguments, mismatched literal-union types, a stale import,
duplicate `<script context="module">` declarations parsed incorrectly, etc.)
scattered across 18 files. Gating on zero would either block CI on unrelated
debt indefinitely, or invite disabling the whole gate at the first false-start
-- both worse than the blind spot this closes. Same shape as
`scripts/check-naming.sh --max-work N`: freeze what's already there, fail only
on anything NEW. The baseline shrinks over time as that debt gets fixed
elsewhere; it must never be edited to silence a genuinely new error.

CLOSED GAP (Mesh #09b9f5ff): EditorStatusActions.svelte used to declare
`export let liveView: DocumentViewBinding;` with a MISSING generic type
argument (DocumentViewBinding<ViewType extends TextFileView> has no default
-- src/ViewBindings.ts:475). That made TypeScript give up on `liveView`'s type
before it ever reached property access, SILENCING property-mismatch errors on
every member read off `liveView` in that one file -- verified directly: with
the three W15 renames (.tracking/.toggleConnection/.view ->
.isTracking/.toggleConnectionIntent/.hostView) reverted to their stale
pre-rename names, svelte-check reported the SAME single generic-arg error and
nothing about the reverted properties.

The one-line fix this comment used to propose (`DocumentViewBinding
<TextFileView>`, "confirmed sufficient in a scratch copy") does NOT actually
work: `ViewActionsMount.render()` (src/ViewBindings.ts) is the single mount
point for BOTH `DocumentViewBinding<ViewType>` and `CanvasViewBinding` --
its `target` param passes `liveView` a value of the common `ViewBinding`
base type, and narrowing the Svelte prop to `DocumentViewBinding<TextFileView>`
makes the canvas call site (`this._actions.render(this.hostView.containerEl,
this, this.canvasDocument)`, CanvasViewBinding) a genuine structural-typing
error -- `CanvasViewBinding` is missing 20+ `DocumentViewBinding`-only members.
Confirmed by actually trying it, not by re-deriving from the scratch-copy
claim above (which never accounted for the canvas call site at all).

Actually closed by a narrower interface, `TrackedViewBinding extends
ViewBinding` (src/ViewBindings.ts), declaring only the two members
`EditorStatusActions.svelte` reads that AREN'T already on `ViewBinding`
(`isTracking`, `toggleConnectionIntent`) -- both `DocumentViewBinding` and
`CanvasViewBinding` already declare these independently, so both satisfy it
structurally with no `implements` needed and no narrowing of `render()`'s
canvas call site. `render()`'s `target` param and the Svelte prop both
retyped to `TrackedViewBinding`. Fixing this ALSO surfaced a second, real,
previously-masked bug in the same props object literal: `linked` was typed
as non-optional `RemoteFolderRecord` while `doc.sharedFolder.linked` is
genuinely `RemoteFolderRecord | undefined` (VaultShare.ts's `_linked` field);
the template already guarded reads with `{#if linked}`, only the prop's own
type declaration was wrong -- widened to `RemoteFolderRecord | undefined`.

Signature = (file, error message) -- deliberately NOT (file, line, col). Line
numbers shift on any unrelated edit above the error in the same file; keying on
them would make the gate flap on every nearby diff. Keying on the message text
means a *reworded* error can look "new" even if nothing about its underlying
cause changed -- an accepted false-positive-toward-caution tradeoff, same one
check-naming.sh's frozen name-lists already make.

Usage:
    check-svelte-types.py                          # compare against baseline, exit 0/1/2
    check-svelte-types.py --update-baseline         # regenerate the baseline file
    check-svelte-types.py --tsconfig PATH           # override tsconfig (self-test uses this)
    check-svelte-types.py --cwd PATH                # run svelte-check from a different directory

Exit codes: 0 = no new errors (baseline holds or has shrunk), 1 = new/regressed
errors found, 2 = could not run or parse svelte-check output -- fail CLOSED,
never silently "clean" on a probe that could not look.
