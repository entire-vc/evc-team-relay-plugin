# Background: Mesh #00631a54, follow-up to #acf0e621's .svelte gate. Two real
# regressions (a hand-rolled __tests__ mock's own field going stale after the
# real production field it stands in for was renamed) shipped past
# tsc/jest/lint/build in one evening because __tests__ was excluded from
# tsc's `include` entirely. This closes that blind spot, ratcheted against a
# frozen baseline of pre-existing unrelated errors (see the .py docstring for
# why a ratchet, not a bare zero).
#
# Three controls, not two: the first two reproduce the ACTUAL historical
# bugs (FakeFolder.connected -> isOnline, MR !228; FakeFile.guid ->
# entityGuid, MR !235) via the `Pick<>` convention now used in
# __tests__/crdtBackgroundSyncPoller.test.ts -- reverting the `Pick<>`
# reference to the old field name must fail, because that field no longer
# exists on the real production type. The third targets a file that
# currently has ZERO tsc errors and has nothing to do with either historical
# case (__tests__/mocks/MockClock.ts) with a synthetic, unrelated type
# error -- proving this is a real general type-checker gate, not something
# that only recognizes the two names it was written to reproduce (the same
# distinction Mesh #09b9f5ff drew for check-svelte-types.py).
