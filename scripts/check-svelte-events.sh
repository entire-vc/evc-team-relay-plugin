# Wires scripts/check-svelte-events.py into CI (job `svelte-events` in

# Background: Mesh #8c9a4223. A Svelte producer/consumer event pair is
# joined by nothing but two string literals in two different files
# (`dispatch("name", ...)` / `on:name={handler}`), and nothing in this
# repo's gates checks that match -- confirmed by renaming a definitely-LIVE
# listener (SettingsPanel.svelte's `on:goBack`, wired to the panel's own
# visible "back" button) to a bogus name and finding tsc/svelte-check/lint/
# build/jest all unchanged. See check-svelte-events.py's docstring for the
# full mechanism and for the mistake (#a4ccff97's own "nothing reddened =
# proof of dead" methodology, which cannot distinguish live from dead
# because NOTHING here executes a click) that this gate exists to not
# repeat.
#
# THREE controls, not two, and specifically NOT skippable: this gate's own
# origin story is a false negative control (a positive control that could
# never fail), so a self-test lacking a genuine live-sample positive control
# is exactly the failure mode being guarded against.
#   1. POSITIVE on a well-known LIVE pair (ModalBackBar -> SettingsPanel's
#      `on:goBack`) -- break it, must go red, naming the file.
#   2. NEGATIVE -- restore, must go green.
#   3. POSITIVE on a DIFFERENT, previously-uninvolved live pair
#      (RelayOnPremServerList's `serversChanged` -> RelayOnPremSettings) --
#      break it, must go red. Proves this isn't hardcoded to recognize only
#      the one case it was built to catch (same "previously silent file"
#      distinction #09b9f5ff and #00631a54 drew for their own gates).
#   4. NEGATIVE -- restore, must go green, baseline count back to the frozen
#      value (0 as of this card).
