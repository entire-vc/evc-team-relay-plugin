// Shared Svelte compiler config for both the esbuild bundle (esbuild.config.mjs)

// Keeping ONE preprocess definition here — rather than a second inline
// `sveltePreprocess()` call in esbuild.config.mjs — means the two can't drift:
// svelte-check parsing <script lang="ts"> with different preprocessing than
// the real build would make its type errors (or its clean passes) describe a
// program that isn't actually what ships.
