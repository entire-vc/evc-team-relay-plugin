/**
 * Unit tests: VaultShare._onReady()'s sync-timeout gate (#3f9d7461)
 *
 * Before this fix: a 30s `onceFreshlySynced()` timeout was caught, logged,
 * and swallowed -- `adoptLocalFiles()` ran exactly as if sync had succeeded,
 * minting fresh guids for any local file it didn't already know about. That
 * is indistinguishable, at that moment, from "another client already
 * published a guid for this path and I just haven't received it yet"
 * (#272f5be4). After this fix: a timeout still lets `_onReady()` proceed
 * (so an already-known folder doesn't get stuck forever), but it tells
 * `adoptLocalFiles()` not to mint -- via the `allowMint` argument, which this
 * test asserts on directly rather than driving the full file-processing
 * pipeline (that's `mintGate.test.ts`'s job; this test is only about
 * whether `_onReady()` correctly computes and passes the flag).
 *
 * Duck-typed via `Object.create(VaultShare.prototype)` -- `_onReady()` is a
 * real prototype method (unlike `adoptLocalFiles`, an arrow-function instance
 * property, which is why it's stubbed directly here rather than exercised),
 * matching the existing convention in documentCanvasLiveOnpremServerId.test.ts:
 * a full construction needs the entire vault/IndexedDB/relay machinery this
 * test has no interest in.
