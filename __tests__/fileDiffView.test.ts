/**
 * Coverage for `FileDiffView`'s two reads of a per-side *file identity* — the
 * tab title (`getDisplayText()`) and the per-side header baked into the
 * generated patch (`recomputeDiff()` -> `structuredPatch(path1, path2, ...)`).
 *
 * Why this file exists (Mesh #b1cd12e0, follow-up to the W9 duck-typing scan
 * in #cf371fdf): `DiffViewState.leftFile`/`rightFile` used to be typed as
 * Obsidian's `TFile`, while both real call sites -- `ViewBindings.openDiffView()`
 * and `y-codemirror.next/LiveEditPlugin` -- pass a live CRDT `Document` as
 * `leftFile`. That compiled with zero casts only because `Document` happened to
 * declare every `TFile` field (`name`/`path`/`extension`/...), so the two
 * reads above resolved by accident rather than by contract. `modify()` and
 * `readContent()` in the same class already narrowed with `instanceof
 * Document` / `instanceof UnsavedFile` before touching anything; these two did
 * not. There was no test on this class at all
 * (`find . -iname '*fileDiffView*' -path '*__tests__*'` -> nothing), so the
 * accident was load-bearing and invisible.
 *
 * `Document` no longer mirrors `TFile` (its fields are `docLabel`/`entryPath`/
 * `docSuffix`/`docStem`/`fileMetrics`/`obsidianVault`/`parentFolder`), so
 * these reads only work now because the view narrows first. The fake below
 * asserts it carries NEITHER `name` NOR `path`, so a future change that
 * re-adds a TFile-shaped field to `Document` cannot make these tests pass by
 * accident all over again — which is exactly how the hazard stayed invisible
 * the first time.
 *
 * Construction convention: `Object.create(Document.prototype)` rather than
 * `new Document(...)`, matching documentCanvasLiveOnpremServerId.test.ts and
 * syncDocumentWebsocketOrdering.test.ts — a real construction drags in the
 * whole VaultShare/IndexedDB/provider stack, none of which these reads touch.
