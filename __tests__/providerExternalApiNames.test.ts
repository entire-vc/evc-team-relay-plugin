/**
 * W10 (Mesh #d9031010) guard: our OWN lifecycle methods were renamed
 * `connect` -> `bringOnline` and `destroy` -> `dismantle`, but the calls
 * ProviderBacked makes INTO the third-party y-sweet provider and into Yjs's
 * own `Y.Doc` must keep their original spellings — `_provider.connect()`,
 * `_provider.destroy()`, `ydoc.destroy()`. Those are external APIs; we do not
 * get to rename them.
 *
 * `tsc` cannot catch a rename that slipped into one of those calls. The
 * provider is mocked/duck-typed in tests, and in production a wrong name on a
 * structurally-typed object either resolves to `undefined` (a TypeError only
 * at teardown time, in a `?.`-guarded path that swallows it) or, worse,
 * silently does nothing — a websocket left open and a Y.Doc never torn down,
 * with a green compile and a green type-check. So the assertion has to be
 * about the LITERAL PROPERTY NAME reaching the external object at runtime.
 *
 * The provider fake below is therefore a Proxy that records every property
 * name read off it. The tests assert both directions:
 *   - the original names ARE read and the underlying functions ARE invoked;
 *   - the NEW names are never read off the external object at all (a rename
 *     that leaked would show up here as `bringOnline`/`dismantle` in the
 *     access log even if the call itself failed silently).
 *
 * Negative control included: a deliberately-miscalled teardown is shown to
 * fail these assertions, so a green run means the probe can actually go red.
