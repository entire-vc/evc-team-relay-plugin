/**
 * Regression test: #0d7bcf0f — TransferQueue.pullIfUnchanged() silently
 * discarded the losing client's unsynced edit in the two-client restart race
 * (#dc11277f), with NO conflict-copy and no trace.
 *
 * Root cause (traced live with temporary instrumentation against the
 * self-hosted stand, see task comments): pullIfUnchanged()'s only guard
 * against clobbering a local edit was "the vault file didn't change DURING
 * this call's own ~2s connect+grace window". That proves the file was
 * stable while this call watched it, not that its content is actually
 * synced. An edit written straight to disk (app.vault.modify() with no live
 * editor binding) that landed BEFORE this call started, and then simply sat
 * there because the client that owns pushing it is offline/mid-restart,
 * satisfies "unchanged" trivially and used to be overwritten with the
 * relay's stale content — no conflict copy, no trace. Live-reproduced 6/6:
 * `/tmp/tr-mechb-probe.log` from the investigation instrumentation caught
 * `pullIfUnchanged CHECK unchanged=true ... WRITING remoteText over vault
 * (OVERWRITE, no conflict-copy)` clobbering a live, never-yet-synced local
 * edit on both sides of the race.
 *
 * Fix: same invariant uploadDocumentViaSocket()/reconcileRelayContent()
 * already use — check the vault content against `Document.getSyncBase()`
 * (what THIS client last CONFIRMED it and the relay agreed on), not just
 * against a same-call snapshot, before ever overwriting. A recorded,
 * diverging base means a genuine unsynced edit: preserve it as a
 * conflict-copy first. No recorded base at all means we can't tell a
 * genuine edit apart from this client's own in-flight seed/upload racing
 * the read (the exact #e1c182a2 false-positive class pullIfUnchanged was
 * built to avoid) — skip the write entirely rather than guess.
 *
 * These tests exercise the real `TransferQueue.pullIfUnchanged()` against a
 * minimal duck-typed Document (real `Document.prototype` in its chain) —
 * same pattern as syncBaseNoConflictCopy.test.ts. Timers are driven by a
 * fake Clock that fires every scheduled callback on the next macrotask, so
 * pullIfUnchanged()'s internal connect-timeout race and fixed grace delay
 * resolve immediately instead of costing real wall-clock seconds per test.
