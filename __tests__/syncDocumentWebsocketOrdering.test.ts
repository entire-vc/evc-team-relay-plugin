/**
 * Regression test: P0 #832dd563 — Obsidian restart doubles file content.
 *
 * Exercises the REAL `TransferQueue.uploadDocumentViaSocket` (not a
 * reimplementation) against a minimal duck-typed `Document` (real
 * `Document.prototype` in its chain via `Object.create`, so `isDocument()`'s
 * `instanceof` check passes, without needing the full VaultShare/vault
 * machinery a real `new Document(...)` would require).
 *
 * Asserts the ordering fix directly: `doc.awaitFirstSync()` — which resolves
 * once this document's own IndexedDB-persisted history has actually loaded
 * — must be called BEFORE `doc.content` is ever read. Before the fix, the
 * content was read first with no wait at all, which is exactly how an
 * already-populated document could read as empty mid-restart (fetchUpdates
 * still in flight) and get blindly re-seeded from the vault file, doubling
 * it once its real history landed a moment later. See
 * backgroundSyncSeedRace.test.ts for the CRDT-level mechanism proof.
