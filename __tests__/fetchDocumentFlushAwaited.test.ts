/**
 * Regression test: obsidian community-plugin validator flagged the two
 * `flush` callbacks fetchCanvas()/fetchDocument() pass into
 * fallbackToWebsocketSync() (`() => doc.vaultShare.writeContents(...)`) as
 * "Promise returned where void expected" (Mesh subtask S2, parent
 * #3eae00a0) -- `flush` was typed `() => void` but fed a Promise-returning
 * function, and fallbackToWebsocketSync() called it WITHOUT awaiting.
 *
 * Same shape of bug as pullIfUnchangedAwaitsWrite.test.ts, just reached via
 * fallbackToWebsocketSync()'s shared HTTP-download-failed tail:
 * fetchDocument() is what `drainLane()` awaits via `lane.run(item)` before
 * it clears `lane.inFlight`/resolves an `enqueueFetch()` waiter (see
 * TransferQueue.ts's queue-lane bookkeeping) -- so a caller awaiting
 * `enqueueFetch()` is entitled to assume the file is actually on disk once
 * that resolves. Before the fix, `flush()`'s promise could still be pending
 * when fetchDocument() (and therefore the whole queue item) already reported
 * "done".
 *
 * Fixture is the fetchItem()-throws-so-falls-back-to-WS-sync path already
 * exercised by fetchDocumentEmptySyncRetry.test.ts (#3b1e0c93) -- same
 * duck-typed Document + MockClock pattern, but `writeContents` here is a
 * manually-resolved deferred promise so the test can assert on ordering.
