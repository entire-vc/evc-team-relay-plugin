# LIVE relay harness

Runs the rewritten sync core against a **real** relay stack — no mocked relay,
no mocked websocket, no mocked tokens, no mocked HTTP.

```bash
BASE=~/trlive-base/infra
LIVE_RELAY=1 \
LIVE_RELAY_LOG_CMD="docker compose -p trlive-check -f \"$BASE/docker-compose.yml\" -f \"$PWD/__tests__/live/docker-compose.live.yml\" logs relay-server --since 5m" \
  npx jest --config jest.live.config.js --runInBand --runTestsByPath __tests__/live/relayLive.test.ts
```

It is **excluded from `npm test`** (`jest.config.js` ignores `__tests__/live/`),
so the hermetic suite never depends on a server being up.

The full run contains **10 tests**. Do not set `LIVE_SKIP_EVICTION` for the full
acceptance run: with it set to `1`, Jest reports the durability test as skipped.

## What it covers

| Step | Covered | How |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Token chain | yes | real per-server `AuthSession` login → real `POST /tokens/relay` → relay-server accepts the CWT on a real websocket |
| Negative controls | yes | a tampered token is rejected while a genuine token connects; the content waiter rejects a deliberately wrong expectation |
| 2. Two-client convergence | yes | two independent `Y.Doc`s through `ProviderBacked` → `client/provider.ts`, asserted on **text content** both directions |
| 3. Persistence across reconnect | yes | writer + witness prove the server holds the text, both disconnect, a fresh client re-reads it; asserts the pre-sync read is empty and the post-sync read is not |
| 3b. Durability past server eviction | yes | all clients leave, the relay's own log is polled until it reports `Terminating loop for <doc>`, then a new client re-reads the text — served from MinIO, not a warm room |
| 4. Folder path through `VaultShare.ts` | no | share create/read-back via `RelayOnPremShareClient` is covered; `VaultShare` itself needs a real Obsidian `Vault`/`FileManager`/`App` — see below |

## Bringing the stack up

The harness needs a running Team Relay stack: postgres, minio, control-plane and
relay-server. Its compose file is not in this repository — it is
`infra/docker-compose.yml` in the `evc-team-relay` repository. That file is
production-shaped: relay-server only exposes its ports inside the compose
network, and nothing is published to the host. `docker-compose.live.yml`, next to
this README, is the override that makes it usable from a test client on the
host. It:

- publishes the ports the harness defaults point at, on `127.0.0.1` only;
- sets `RELAY_PUBLIC_URL` and `RELAY_AUDIENCE` for the local stack (see
  [the audience section](#stack-requirement-the-cwt-audience-must-match));
- starts only the four services the harness talks to (plus the one-shot
  `minio-init` and `control-plane-migrate`), leaving out caddy, the workers,
  prometheus, grafana and web-publish — the last one cannot be built without a
  token for private packages, and caddy would publish ports 80 and 443;
- sets `CONTROL_PLANE_PUBLIC_URL` to `http://localhost:58080`, the base URL the
  control-plane hands out for file uploads and downloads;
- keeps all state in named volumes, so `down -v` removes everything and two
  projects never share MinIO data.

| host port | service | container port |
|---|---|---|
| 58080 | control-plane | 8000 |
| 58081 | relay-server | 8080 |
| 59000 | minio | 9000 |
| 55432 | postgres | 5432 |

**Use a separate checkout of `evc-team-relay` for this**, not one that holds a real
install: the setup below writes `infra/.env` and `infra/relay/relay.toml` in it.
Both are git-ignored, and a copy without git history is enough:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 <evc-team-relay remote> ~/trlive-base
# or, without git history:  mkdir -p ~/trlive-base && git archive HEAD | tar -x -C ~/trlive-base
cd ~/trlive-base/infra
```

One-time setup — a keypair, an `.env` and a `relay.toml` whose `[server].url`
equals `RELAY_AUDIENCE` from the override. This needs **OpenSSL 3**: the system
`openssl` on macOS is LibreSSL and has no `ed25519` (`brew install openssl@3` and
put it first in `PATH`). The guards below stop on that instead of leaving
`RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY` empty, which the control-plane refuses to start with. Run the
block as a script (`bash setup.sh`), not pasted into an interactive shell: a
failed guard calls `exit`.

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out relay_private.pem || exit 1
PRIV=$(openssl base64 -A -in relay_private.pem)
[ -n "$PRIV" ] || { echo "no private key generated"; exit 1; }
# The raw 32-byte public key is the tail of the DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo.
PUB=$(openssl pkey -in relay_private.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | openssl base64 -A)
rm relay_private.pem

cp env.example .env
sed -i.bak "s|^RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY=.*|RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY=$PRIV|; s|^JWT_SECRET=.*|JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|" .env

cp relay/relay.toml.example relay/relay.toml
sed -i.bak \
  -e 's|^url = .*|url = "http://localhost:58080"|' \
  -e 's|key_id = "REPLACE_WITH_KEY_ID"|key_id = "relay_cp_dev"|' \
  -e "s|public_key = \"REPLACE_WITH_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64\"|public_key = \"$PUB\"|" \
  -e 's|access_key = "MINIO_ROOT_USER"|access_key = "relay"|' \
  -e 's|secret_key = "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD"|secret_key = "change-this-too"|' \
  relay/relay.toml
rm -f .env.bak relay/relay.toml.bak
```

`env.example` already carries the bootstrap admin the harness logs in as
(`admin@example.com` / `super-secret-pass`, the `LIVE_ADMIN_*` defaults below).

Bring it up, **rebuilding the images from the checkout** — run from this
repository's root, with `BASE` pointing at the checkout's `infra/` directory:

```bash
BASE=~/trlive-base/infra
docker compose -p trlive-check \
  -f "$BASE/docker-compose.yml" \
  -f __tests__/live/docker-compose.live.yml \
  up -d --build
```

Check that it is healthy by looking at the response body, not only the status
code — an error page can be a 200:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:58080/health          # {"ok":true}
curl -s http://localhost:58080/health/ready    # database-checked readiness
curl -s http://localhost:58081/ready          # relay-server: {"ok":true}
```

Run all ten tests from this repository's root, and point the eviction log reader
at the **same project and compose files**:

```bash
BASE=~/trlive-base/infra
LIVE_RELAY=1 \
LIVE_RELAY_LOG_CMD="docker compose -p trlive-check -f \"$BASE/docker-compose.yml\" -f \"$PWD/__tests__/live/docker-compose.live.yml\" logs relay-server --since 5m" \
  npx jest --config jest.live.config.js --runInBand --runTestsByPath __tests__/live/relayLive.test.ts
```

Expect `10 passed, 10 total` with no skips. A missing/wrong log command is an
error, not proof of durability. The table above describes this full run.

### Audience negative control

On this disposable stack, change only the control-plane audience, leaving
`relay.toml` unchanged:

```bash
cat > "$BASE/live-wrong-audience.yml" <<'YAML'
services:
  control-plane:
    environment:
      RELAY_AUDIENCE: "https://wrong-audience.example"
YAML
docker compose -p trlive-check -f "$BASE/docker-compose.yml" \
  -f __tests__/live/docker-compose.live.yml -f "$BASE/live-wrong-audience.yml" \
  up -d --wait --wait-timeout 120 control-plane
LIVE_RELAY=1 npx jest --config jest.live.config.js --runInBand \
  --runTestsByPath __tests__/live/relayLive.test.ts --testNamePattern 'relay-server ACCEPTS'
```

The selected connection test must **fail**, and the relay-server log must name
`CWT audience validation failed`. A successful login or token mint alone does
not prove relay acceptance. Restore the correct audience by recreating the
control-plane with the original two-file configuration:

```bash
docker compose -p trlive-check -f "$BASE/docker-compose.yml" \
  -f __tests__/live/docker-compose.live.yml \
  up -d --wait --wait-timeout 120 control-plane
```

Then rerun the full ten-test command above and require it to pass again.

Stop it and delete its state:

```bash
docker compose -p trlive-check -f "$BASE/docker-compose.yml" -f __tests__/live/docker-compose.live.yml down -v
```

Always pass **both** `-f` files, and use the same pair every time. Recreating a
container from the base file alone silently drops the port mappings and
`RELAY_AUDIENCE`: `localhost:58081/ready` then refuses connections while
`docker compose ps` still shows everything healthy. `docker compose ls -a` prints
the files an existing project was created with.

The first `--build` is slow: relay-server compiles a Rust workspace from source,
roughly ten minutes on a laptop. Later runs reuse the build cache; after changing
control-plane or relay-server code, rerun the same `up -d --build` and only the
changed images are rebuilt and recreated.

**Do not run this on a Docker host that also runs a real Team Relay install.**
Named volumes are isolated per project, but the base file pins the image tags
`infra-control-plane:latest` and `infra-relay-server:latest`, which are shared
across projects: `up --build` retags them, and the real install's next recreate
would start the test build.

## Environment

The HTTP endpoints and bootstrap admin defaults match the local Docker stack
above. The relay-log default still targets the legacy `trlive` project: every
full run on `trlive-check` **must override `LIVE_RELAY_LOG_CMD` with both compose
files**, as shown in the full-run commands.

| var | default |
|---|---|
| `LIVE_RELAY` | *(required)* set to `1` |
| `LIVE_CONTROL_PLANE` | `http://localhost:58080` |
| `LIVE_RELAY_SERVER` | `http://localhost:58081` |
| `LIVE_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@example.com` |
| `LIVE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `super-secret-pass` |
| `LIVE_RELAY_LOG_CMD` | `docker compose -p trlive logs relay-server --since 5m` |
| `LIVE_SKIP_EVICTION` | unset; `1` skips the ~40s durability test |

Override `LIVE_RELAY_LOG_CMD` for `trlive-check` using both compose files, as
shown in the full-run command above.

The suite fails loudly in `beforeAll` if either service is not answering, rather
than producing a confusing mid-test websocket error.

## Stack requirement: the CWT audience must match

The relay-server validates the `aud` claim on every token against its own
`relay.toml` `[server].url`. The control-plane derives that claim from
`RELAY_PUBLIC_URL` (its host and port, forced to `https://`) unless
`RELAY_AUDIENCE` is set explicitly.

If they disagree, **every** connection is refused and the only visible symptom is
a websocket that never opens. The relay-server names it plainly in its log:

```
WARN y_sweet_core::cwt: CWT audience validation failed - token intended for
     different service expected="http://localhost:58080" found="https://example.com"
```

For the local stack that means the control-plane needs the following (set for you
by `docker-compose.live.yml`, together with a `relay.toml` whose `[server].url` is
`http://localhost:58080`):

```yaml
RELAY_PUBLIC_URL: "ws://localhost:58081"   # reachable relay-server, client-facing
RELAY_AUDIENCE:   "http://localhost:58080" # must equal relay.toml [server].url exactly
```

`infra/env.example`'s shipped `RELAY_PUBLIC_URL=wss://${DOMAIN_BASE}` produces
`aud=https://example.com`, which does not match, and additionally points clients
at a host that does not resolve. Even without the shipped value, leaving
`RELAY_AUDIENCE` unset would derive `https://localhost:58081` from the local
`RELAY_PUBLIC_URL`, which is not `http://localhost:58080` either.

## What is mocked, and why that is allowed

Only `obsidian` — mapped by `jest.live.config.js` to `__tests__/live/obsidianLive.ts`.
That module re-exports the shared unit-test mock for the inert bits (`TFile`,
`Notice`, `debounce`, …) and implements `requestUrl` over Node's real `fetch`, so
`src/platformFetch.ts` and everything above it issue genuine HTTP.

The Obsidian app API is a true external boundary per the repo's mocking
convention; the relay, the tokens and the CRDT traffic are not, and none of them
are stubbed here.

`ProviderBacked` receives a real `AuthSession` configured with one local server.
The suite logs in through that server's real auth provider and supplies the same
server ID to `ProviderBacked` and the `RelayCredentialCache` provider map. It
uses the current `crdtDoc`, `entryPath`, `isOnline`, `isSynced` and
`onceEverSynced()` APIs. No auth-session or credential-cache behavior is stubbed.

The only additional adapter is the Obsidian plugin-data-file boundary: an
in-memory `loadData`/`saveData` backend for real `Settings`/`SettingsScope` objects.
The single-server run verifies the current multi-server API wiring; it does not
claim isolation between two different servers, awareness/cursor rendering,
attachment transfer or folder-level `VaultShare` coverage.

## Why step 4 stops where it does

`VaultShare`'s constructor takes twelve collaborators — `Vault`, `FileManager`,
`App`, `RelayRegistry`, `FileHashCache`, `TransferQueue`,
`SettingsScope`, … Driving it headlessly would mean standing in for
`RelayRegistry` and `TransferQueue`, which are themselves part of the rewritten
core: mocking them would defeat the purpose of this harness. Folder-level
coverage needs a real vault (an Obsidian test vault or an e2e harness), not more
test doubles.

## New Markdown note in two real vaults

`scripts/check-note-bootstrap.py` exercises the folder path in two actual
Obsidian instances. Use disposable vaults and a local self-hosted relay stack;
the check creates a note and leaves it in both vaults for inspection.

1. Install the same plugin build in both vaults. Start each Obsidian instance
   with a separate `--user-data-dir` and `--remote-debugging-port`.
2. Enable the plugin, authenticate both vaults to the local server, and restart
   Obsidian so plugin startup has completed.
3. Connect one folder in each vault to the same shared-folder GUID. Use different
   local folder names, leave `otherTypes=false`, and wait for both folders to
   be online. For an HTTP reverse proxy, route the control-plane API and the
   relay's `/d/*` websocket paths to their respective services. The relay token
   audience must match the relay's configured server URL.
4. Install `websocket-client` in a Python environment, then run:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-note-bootstrap.py \
  --writer-port 9471 --reader-port 9472 \
  --guid <shared-folder-guid> --version 0.0.21 \
  --note bootstrap-check.md
```

The check creates an empty Markdown file via the real Vault API, writes four
successive edits, and waits up to 45 seconds. Success requires the writer's and
receiver's disk content to match, the receiver's child CRDT to contain that same
text, and both parent metadata maps to name that child GUID. No repair command
or direct upload is invoked. It prints parent claims, metadata, child content,
and a SHA256 of the expected text; failure exits nonzero. Use a fresh note name
for each run: existing files are never overwritten.

Run the identical command against an affected build as the negative control.
The hermetic companion regression is the pending-local-edit case in
`pullIfUnchangedConflictCopy.test.ts`; it fails before commit `ece546c` and passes
after the fix released in 0.0.14. The real-vault check is manual because CI does
not run Obsidian.
