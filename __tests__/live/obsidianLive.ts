/**
 * Obsidian API stand-in for the LIVE harness (__tests__/live/*.test.ts).
 *
 * The Obsidian app API is a TRUE external boundary (§1o mocking convention) —
 * it is not the thing under test and cannot be run headless. Everything else
 * in the live harness is real: the relay-server, the control-plane, the HTTP
 * calls, the websockets and the tokens.
 *
 * The one member that matters here is `requestUrl`. In `__tests__/mocks/
 * obsidian.ts` it is a bare `jest.fn()` returning undefined, which is correct
 * for unit tests but would make `src/platformFetch.ts` a no-op — and platformFetch
 * is on the path under test (it is what RelayOnPremAuthProvider,
 * RelayOnPremTokenProvider and RelayOnPremShareClient issue every request
 * through). So here `requestUrl` is a thin adapter over Node's real `fetch`:
 * real sockets, real bytes, real status codes. Nothing is faked; the shape is
 * translated from Obsidian's RequestUrlResponse to fetch's Response, which is
 * exactly what the real Obsidian implementation does.
 *
 * Every other export is re-exported verbatim from the shared unit-test mock so
 * the two stay in step.
