/**
 * Unit test: ShareRegistry._dedupeByPath() prefers a candidate with a valid
 * guid over one without, when the same path appears more than once in
 * persisted settings (Mesh #a2ef4d4b).
 *
 * The bug: the old path-only dedupe kept the FIRST record it saw at a given
 * path (only overriding it when a later record had `relay` set and the
 * kept one didn't). It never looked at guid validity at all. A `data.json`
 * already triplicated by the #0c38f743 class -- one corrupt entry with no
 * guid, one phantom entry with the literal string guid "undefined", one
 * genuinely valid entry -- has `relay` set on all three, so the old dedupe
 * always kept the FIRST (invalid) one. The #0c38f743 restore guard then
 * correctly refused that single candidate, and the folder never came back
 * at all: not "reduced to 2 stale records" (what that MR's own commit
 * message documented for a freshly-triplicating single corrupt input), but
 * a full, silent loss of the share, because the one valid record two slots
 * later was never even offered to the guard.
 *
 * This test exercises the real ShareRegistry.restore() (dedupe + guard +
 * factory call) with a minimal fake Vault/shareFactory/persistedShares --
 * not a reimplementation of the dedupe logic, so it actually proves the
 * integration.
