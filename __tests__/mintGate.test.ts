/**
 * Unit tests: mintGate.partitionByKnownGuid (#3f9d7461)
 *
 * VaultShare._onReady()'s sync-timeout gate used to fail OPEN: if
 * onceFreshlySynced() didn't resolve within 30s, it logged a warning and
 * fell straight through to adoptLocalFiles(), which mints a fresh guid for
 * ANY local file the folderIndex doesn't already have an entry for --
 * indistinguishable, at that moment, from "another client already
 * published a guid for this path and I just haven't received it yet"
 * (#272f5be4's disjoint-guid symptom). This module is the pure decision
 * VaultShare.adoptLocalFiles() now makes when it can't confirm a fresh sync:
 * split files into ones it already has a guid for (safe either way) and
 * ones it doesn't (must not be minted this round).
