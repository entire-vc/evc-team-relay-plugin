/**
 * Regression test: P0 #832dd563 — Obsidian restart doubles file content.
 *
 * Root cause: `TransferQueue.uploadDocumentViaSocket` read `doc.text`
 * (`ytext.toJSON()`) to decide whether a document was "empty, therefore
 * brand new, therefore safe to seed from the vault file" WITHOUT first
 * confirming the document's own local persistence (IndexedDB, via
 * `doc.whenSynced()`) had actually finished loading. On a cold Obsidian
 * restart reconnecting many shared folders at once, IndexedDB's fetchUpdates
 * for a given document can still be in flight when this check runs — so an
 * already-populated document can legitimately read as empty for a moment.
 *
 * `initContentClaim.ts` (TR-15, #1c52a010) correctly stops a SECOND CLIENT
 * from also inserting into a genuinely-empty doc during that window — but it
 * does nothing to stop THIS client's own not-yet-applied persisted history
 * from landing a moment later and merging with a seed insert that was made
 * under a false "it's empty" premise. Two independent sets of CRDT ops
 * (the real persisted content, and the freshly-seeded copy of the same
 * content) land in the same Y.Doc and Yjs concatenates them — the file ends
 * up with its own content duplicated back-to-back, exactly the reported
 * symptom (first half of the corrupted file byte-identical to the second).
 *
 * These tests use real Y.Doc instances and the REAL, unmodified
 * initContentClaim.ts exports — proving the claim mechanism's insufficiency
 * against production code, not a reimplementation of it — plus the actual
 * fix shape (apply persisted history before ever reading the doc as "empty",
 * mirroring `await doc.whenSynced()`).
