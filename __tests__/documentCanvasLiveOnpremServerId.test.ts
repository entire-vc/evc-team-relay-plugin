/**
 * Regression test for #cbb50a40 (hardening follow-up to #3dfe64b0 / #37a9ba4e):
 * Document and CanvasDocument used to capture `onpremServerId` once, as a constructor
 * argument passed straight through to `ProviderBacked`, instead of reading it
 * live off their parent VaultShare the way VaultShare itself already
 * does (see the doc comment on `ProviderBacked.getOnpremServerId()`).
 *
 * `onpremServerId` is assigned to a VaultShare's config AFTER the folder
 * (and its documents) are constructed at some call sites — a document built
 * before that assignment would otherwise be permanently pinned to whatever
 * value existed at construction time (usually `undefined`, i.e. the default
 * server), even after the folder is later attributed to a specific on-prem
 * server. `getOnpremServerId()` is the single seam both classes route every
 * token request through, so asserting on it directly (rather than driving a
 * full `getProviderToken()` call, which needs a real ResourceAddress/tokenStore/vault)
 * exercises exactly the fixed code path.
 *
 * Duck-typed via `Object.create(...Prototype)` rather than a real
 * `new Document(...)`/`new CanvasDocument(...)`, matching the existing convention in
 * syncDocumentWebsocketOrdering.test.ts — a full construction needs the
 * entire VaultShare/vault/IndexedDB machinery this test has no interest in.
