/**
 * Regression test: #7e188e94 — CanvasDocument.nodeText() has the same unguarded
 * empty-check-then-seed race as #832dd563 (not yet exploited).
 *
 * Root cause: `CanvasDocument.nodeText()` reads a node's `Y.Text` and treats
 * `ytext.toJSON() === ""` as "genuinely new node, safe to seed from the
 * local Obsidian view's `node.text`" -- exactly the same shape as the P0
 * fixed in #832dd563 for `TransferQueue.uploadDocumentViaSocket`. If this
 * canvas's own IndexedDB-persisted history hasn't replayed yet
 * (`isLocallyPersisted === false`), an empty read is a false negative: the
 * real content just hasn't arrived. Seeding on that false premise, then
 * having the real persisted history land a moment later, duplicates the
 * node's text (Yjs concatenates, doesn't dedupe) -- same symptom class as
 * #832dd563, one CRDT node instead of one file.
 *
 * Two call sites into `nodeText()` were confirmed reachable before sync:
 *   1. CanvasDocument.mergeCanvasData() <- CanvasViewPatch's patched requestSave/applyHistory
 *      -- fixed by gating CanvasViewPatch construction on
 *      `CanvasViewBinding.attach()`'s `awaitFullyConnected()` (ViewBindings.ts), which
 *      awaits `awaitFirstSync()` first. Not exercised here: ViewBindings.ts pulls
 *      in Svelte components, y-protocols (ESM), and a yjs deep-import
 *      outside yjs's package.json `exports` map, none of which this
 *      repo's Jest setup can currently load (a pre-existing gap, unrelated
 *      to this fix) -- verified by direct import attempt and confirmed by
 *      reading the source (ViewBindings.ts:318-351).
 *   2. LiveNodePlugin.ts's `getYText()` -- a CodeMirror extension
 *      registered globally whenever any view is open
 *      (ViewBindingRegistry.load()), independent of any single view's
 *      readiness, so it isn't covered by fix #1. Fixed by routing through
 *      the new `CanvasDocument.textNodeSafe()` (this file) instead of calling
 *      `nodeText()` directly.
 *
 * `textNodeSafe()` is deliberately a separate method rather than a guard
 * inside `nodeText()` itself: `CanvasDocument.mergeCanvasData()` marks a node as "known"
 * (added to `crdtNodes`) in the same pass that seeds it, regardless of
 * whether the seed happened -- so if `nodeText()` itself silently declined
 * to seed while unsynced, that node's text would never be retried and
 * would stay empty forever. `textNodeSafe()` sidesteps this: it doesn't
 * participate in `crdtNodes` bookkeeping at all, so a later real `nodeText()`
 * call (once synced) can still seed the node normally. See CanvasDocument.ts's
 * doc comment on `textNodeSafe()` for the full reasoning.
 *
 * These tests exercise the REAL, unmodified `CanvasDocument.nodeText()` and the
 * real `CanvasDocument.textNodeSafe()` against real `Y.Doc` instances -- no
 * reimplementation of the seeding logic -- using `Object.create
 * (CanvasDocument.prototype)` to get the real prototype methods without needing
 * the full ProviderBacked/VaultShare/IndexedDB construction machinery, the
 * same pattern `uploadDocumentViaSocketOrdering.test.ts` established for
 * `Document` in the #832dd563 fix.
