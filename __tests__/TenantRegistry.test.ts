/**
 * Tests for TenantRegistry — TR-58 root-cause confirmation.
 *
 * This build (see esbuild.config.mjs: apiUrl = authUrl = "") compiles no
 * System3/PocketBase backend URL at all — it's relay-onprem only. The only
 * way resolveApiUrl()/resolveAuthUrl() return a non-empty value is a
 * successfully validated custom tenant. These tests pin that default-empty
 * behavior, which is the precondition for the TR-58 finding (AuthSession
 * falling through to `new PocketBase("")` when relay-onprem is disabled).
