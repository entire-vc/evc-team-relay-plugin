/**
 * Regression test for #37a9ba4e: `onpremServerId` was lost when a caller
 * wrote it right after creating the VaultShare that owns it.
 *
 * Root cause (found by live two-stand reproduction, see the task thread):
 * `Settings<T>.mutate()` computed the new value synchronously but only
 * assigned it to `this.currentValue` AFTER an `await this.backend.loadData()`
 * round-trip. `_instantiateVaultShare` (main.ts) creates a shared folder's
 * settings node via an unawaited `void folderSettings.mutateValue(...)`, then
 * returns the folder synchronously; callers (QuickShareModal etc.) then
 * wrote `onpremServerId` via a second, separately-awaited settings write
 * issued right after. Because the first write's `this.currentValue` assignment
 * was deferred behind a real `await`, the second write's `SettingsScope`
 * read the settings root *before* the first write's node existed in
 * memory — and because `Settings.mutate()` unconditionally overwrites
 * `this.currentValue` with its own (now-stale) computed snapshot when it
 * finally resolves, whichever of the two writes' internal disk round-trip
 * resolved last clobbered the other, dropping either the folder's own fields
 * (path/guid/relay) or the just-written `onpremServerId`.
 *
 * The fix moves the `this.currentValue = updated` assignment in
 * `Settings.mutate()` to before its internal disk round-trip, so two
 * `mutate()`/`update()` calls issued back-to-back (the second right after the
 * first, without awaiting it) compose in call order instead of racing — see
 * the comment on `Settings.mutate()` in `src/SettingsPersistence.ts`.
 *
 * This test reproduces the exact call shape (fire-and-forget node-creation
 * write immediately followed by a second, awaited write to a field on that
 * same node) against the real `Settings`/`SettingsScope` classes, not
 * mocks — a mocked settings layer can't reproduce a race that lives inside
 * the real implementation's own await ordering.
