/**
 * Tests for the vault-root path convention translation and the TFolder
 * resolver built on top of it.
 *
 * `isRootSharePath`/`toSharePath` cover the wire-convention translation.
 * `resolveShareFolder` covers the actual bug this follow-up fixes: a plain
 * `vault.getAbstractFileByPath(share.path)` returns `null` for a root share
 * (Obsidian's real root `TFolder.path` is `"/"`, not the wire convention's
 * `""`), silently breaking every caller that resolves "the TFolder a share's
 * `.path` points at" without going through this helper.
