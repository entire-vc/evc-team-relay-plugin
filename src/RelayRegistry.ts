// RelayRegistry used to be built entirely around a PocketBase-backed DAO/Store
// layer (System 3 cloud) -- DAO interfaces mirroring PocketBase collections,
// a generic LiveCollection/Store graph, and one wrapper class per record type
// (RelayAuto, UserRecord, etc.), all populated via realtime subscriptions
// fired from a live `pb: PocketBase` client. That entire layer was removed as
// dead code (#c671c032): the plugin only ever ships relay-onprem mode
// (relayOnPrem.enabled defaults to true, with no UI path to turn it off), and
// AuthSession never constructs a PocketBase client in that mode -- `pb` was
// always `null` here, so `buildGraph()` always returned before building
// anything and `this.policyManager`/`this.store` were never assigned.
//
// What's kept: every externally-called method, each reproducing EXACTLY the
// behavior its PocketBase-gated body already had when `pb` was null -- a
// graceful no-op where the original short-circuited on `this.pb?.`, or the
// original thrown error message where it asserted `required(this.pb,
// "message")`. This is a pure dead-code removal: no external caller's
// observed behavior changes.
//
// The nine NotifierMap fields this comment used to describe as "kept
// shapes" (relays/users/providers/remoteFolders/relayInvitations/
// relayRoles/folderRoles/subscriptions/storageQuotas) were themselves
// removed as a second dead-code pass (#6f6e55ba): nothing anywhere in the
// tree ever called `.set()`/`.delete()` on any of them, so they stayed
// permanently empty in the shipped build forever. Their readers cascaded:
// PolicyManager.ts's entire dependency-driven authorization engine was
// never constructed by anything and was removed in that same pass;
// `getCollectionMapByName()` existed only to feed it and is gone with it;
// the live UI/sync readers (SettingsPanel.svelte, VaultShare.ts,
// ViewBindings.ts) were each updated in place to reproduce the same
// always-empty behavior they already observed, without the pretense of a
// live collection behind it. (MemberInviteModalContent.svelte and
// PublishFolderModalContent.svelte, both named here originally, were
// themselves removed later as unreachable modules in #6fbffbb2;
// OnPremSetupModalContent.svelte was itself removed later, along with
// `createSelfHostedRelay()`, in #3389c7a7 -- the command it backed could
// never succeed against this dead layer.) `PolicyManager.ts` itself kept
// existing after that pass -- it still held `ObservablePermission`, the
// return type of this class's own `can()`/`userCan()` -- until those two
// methods were removed as dead code in #2ee0effc, at which point
// `PolicyManager.ts` had zero live importers left and was deleted whole
// in #7f2517e8.
// `roleCatalog` is the one map that is actually filled (two seeded rows,
// constructor below) and stays untouched.
