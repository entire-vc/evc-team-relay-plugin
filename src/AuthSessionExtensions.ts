 *
 * The old behavior unconditionally cleared `this.user` on any login
 * failure — a failed RE-login (e.g. a typo'd password re-entered while
 * already logged in, for whatever reason) silently logged the user out of
 * a session that was working fine. Restoring the pre-attempt snapshot
 * fixes this: when there was no prior session (`previousUser` is
 * `undefined`), the restored value is `undefined` too, reproducing the old
 * (correct-in-that-case) behavior; when there was one, it survives the
 * failed attempt instead of being wiped.
 *
 * Safe to call unconditionally (no `hadValidSession` branch needed) only
 * because `loginWithEmailAndPassword`'s try block is a single `await` — on
 * failure `this.user` was never mutated before the catch runs, so there's
 * no partial-mutation state to reconcile. Contrast
 * `RelayOnPremAuthProvider.loginWithPassword` (TR-52, #914c2b9d), which
 * restores several fields individually because its step 1 can succeed and
 * mutate state before its step 2 fails.
