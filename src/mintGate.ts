 *
 * Extracted as a pure function so `VaultShare._onReady()`'s 30s sync-timeout
 * gate (#3f9d7461) is testable without constructing a full VaultShare: a
 * timed-out sync means "no metadata for this vpath anywhere" and "this vpath
 * genuinely isn't tracked yet" read as the same local `false` -- an
 * already-shared file this client just hasn't heard about yet would
 * otherwise be minted a fresh, disjoint guid (#272f5be4) instead of waiting
 * to learn the real one. Files already in `hasEntry` are unaffected either
 * way; only genuinely-unknown files are held back.
