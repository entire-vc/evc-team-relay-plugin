/**
 * Renders a price the way the currency is actually written, not the way the
 * interface language happens to be set.
 *
 * The rule this file exists to enforce: **the symbol follows the currency of
 * the price, never the language of the UI.** A RUB price renders `290 ₽` even
 * when Obsidian's interface is English -- a Russian buyer must not be shown
 * `RUB290` because of an interface setting. (Decided on the parent task
 * `#a15817aa`; do not re-litigate per-caller.)
 *
 * What it replaces: `const sym = currency === "USD" ? "$" : currency`, which
 * printed the literal ISO code glued to the number (`RUB290`). That is not a
 * price notation in any language, and it was the string about to be shown to
 * a bank.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `Intl.NumberFormat`: its `ru-RU` group separator is a
 * NO-BREAK SPACE (U+00A0), and the already-approved price copy on
 * teamrelay.ru uses a plain space (U+0020) -- verified byte-by-byte against
 * `src/pages/pricing/index.astro` in the site repo: `'2 790 ₽'` is
 * `32 20 37 39 30 20 20BD`. Since the plugin's prices sit next to the site's
 * in the same purchase decision, they must match the site exactly rather
 * than match a locale database. Intl output also varies with the ICU build
 * shipped in whatever Electron the user's Obsidian is on; this does not.
 *
 * No i18n dependency on purpose -- this module formats the *amount* only.
 * The `/mo` vs `/мес` suffix is interface language, not currency, so it is
 * composed by the caller from the phrasebook (`billing.period.*`).
