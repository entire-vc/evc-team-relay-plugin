 * Decide which of the offered plans is the one the account is actually on.
 *
 * Resolved ONCE against the whole list rather than per card. The earlier
 * per-card version asked each card "am I the free one?" by looking at its own
 * prices; on a deployment where the paid plan carries no non-zero price both
 * cards answered yes and both rendered the "Current" badge.
 *
 * Two current plans is worse than none: it asserts something that cannot be
 * true and hides which plan actually bills the user. So every ambiguous case
 * returns null - the UI then shows the badge on nothing, which is honest.
