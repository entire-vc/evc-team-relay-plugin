	// Design choice -- `render` item, not a `type: "page"` sub-page:
	// confirmed against Obsidian 1.13.7's actual runtime (app.asar, function
	// `Sie`, the settings-search entry collector) that a `type: "page"` item
	// using the imperative `page: () => SettingPage` factory contributes
	// NOTHING to the search index by itself -- `Sie` only recurses into a
	// page's declarative `items`, it never indexes the page itself. Only a
	// leaf definition (control/render/action) with `name`/`desc`/`aliases`
	// is what `Mie.search()` actually matches against. So a bare
	// `SettingDefinitionPage` would not have fixed the validator warning at
	// all -- it would have added a click without adding a search hit. A
	// `render` item is the only type that both (a) is indexed for search and
	// (b) can be drawn immediately, with no extra navigation step.

				// the definition's `name`/`desc` BEFORE invoking `render()` --
				// so those fields are already applied to the row when this
				// callback runs. `mountPanel()` then empties the whole row
				// (wiping that pre-applied name/desc DOM) to mount the panel
				// edge-to-edge; that's safe because the search index is built
				// from the definition object itself, not from the rendered
