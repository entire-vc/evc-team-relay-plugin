	// activeManageView derives which view (if any) is active as plain data,
	// and the markup below renders it through <svelte:component>.
	//
	// Three events used to be listened for on that <svelte:component> --
	// `manageSharedFolder` (removed by #a4ccff97), `close` and
	// `manageRemoteFolder` (removed here, Mesh #8c9a4223). All three were
	// dead: SyncedFolderManager is the only component ever substituted
	// through <svelte:component> (ManageViewState's own single-variant
	// union), and it dispatches only `goBack` (SyncedFolderManager.svelte:
	// 17,28) -- confirmed by reading its dispatch() call sites, not by grep
	// absence (grep cannot prove a dynamic Svelte binding is unreachable),
	// and now enforced continuously by scripts/check-svelte-events.py's
	// static reachability graph (CI job `svelte-events`).
	//
	// #a4ccff97's own closing comment here previously cited "renamed the
	// listener to a bogus name, reran build/jest/lint, nothing reddened" as
	// its proof of deadness. That reasoning was retracted by #8c9a4223: the
	// exact same experiment on `on:goBack` above -- a definitely LIVE
	// listener wired to this panel's own visible "back" button -- produces
	// the IDENTICAL all-green result, because nothing in this repo's gates
	// executes a Svelte click-to-dispatch interaction. "Nothing reddened"
	// was never evidence of deadness; it was evidence that no tool here
	// looks. The real proof is the static one stated above (read every
	// dispatch() site of the only substitutable component), which
	// check-svelte-events.py now re-derives and enforces on every push
	// instead of relying on this comment being trusted forever.
