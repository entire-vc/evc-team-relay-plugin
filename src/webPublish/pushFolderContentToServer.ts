// either is the per-file conditional sync-write protocol, keyed by
// share id so it works before the share has ever been published (unlike
// syncFolderFileContent, which needs an existing web_slug and so
// can only ever run AFTER a first successful publish). Without this,
// toggling "Publish to Web" on a folder share 400s forever regardless of
// how much real local content exists, because the generic
// UpdateShareRequest.web_folder_items the toggle sends is structure-only
// (path/name/type) by design (#d425920b).
//
// Returns the paths that could not be written (e.g. #546ce7e3: a name the
// server's path validator rejects) so the caller can still publish
// everything else and tell the user what was skipped, instead of one bad
// file aborting the whole publish -- matching the existing per-file
// try/catch idiom in syncFolderFileContent's loop.
